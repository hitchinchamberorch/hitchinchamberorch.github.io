        <h3>Hitchin Chamber Orchestra</h3>
        <p>
          A friendly string orchestra based in Hitchin aiming to present high
          standard concerts in the town’s lovely venues. Music played covers a
          wide variety of different styles and genres and the orchestra often
          collaborates with guest instrumentalists and singers.
        </p>
        <h3>Before the Romance</h3>
        <p>
          Join us on Saturday 16th November at 7:30pm for an evening of music
          from the classical era to include Beethoven’s beautiful Romance in F
          for violin and orchestra. For more details, please see our
          <a href="/concerts">concerts page</a>.

          What makes an orchestra like HCO tick?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Fundamentally, it is the deep desire of a dedicated group of musicians
          to enjoy, together, something profoundly important to them and to
          share this experience with the wider community. We are hugely grateful
          to our followers, both new and old, for their support which enables
          our continuing programme of concert making to thrive.
