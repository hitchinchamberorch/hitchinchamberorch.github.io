        <h2>Join us</h2>
        <p>The orchestra comprises a steadily growing number of enthusiastic members each at a unique stage on their own musical journey.
          Our commitment to achieving the highest standards is widely recognised as is our ethos of encouraging and enabling all members to develop and enjoy their playing as fully as possible.
          If you would like to play with the orchestra or find out more about us, please send a message to <a href="mailto:hitchinchamberorch@gmail.com">Nick Evans-Pughe/Musical Director</a> who will be delighted to get in touch.</p>
        <p>Although we are essentially a String Orchestra we do invite non-string players to perform with us from time to time, so we are always pleased to receive expressions of interest from you, too.</p>
